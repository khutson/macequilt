# macequilt
Manitou Art Center Electronic Quilt project

This repository has the micropython code and other info for the class/project.

We'll be using uPyCraft, which runs on windows and linux (ubuntu 16).

You can find uPyCraft binaries at https://github.com/DFRobot/uPyCraft

We'll be using the ESP8266 and/or ESP32.

This is a work in progress, so be sure to "git pull" changes often. The Git Desktop app for windows is easy to use and will make it easier to get the latest code. You can find it at https://desktop.github.com/

Copy the workspace/boot.py and workspace/artneopixel.py files:
1. open each file in uPyCraft then send to the ESP using "Download" 

To test, "Download and Run" artneopixel.py. It will run a demo.
